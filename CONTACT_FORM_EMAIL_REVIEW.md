# Contact Form Email Functionality Review

## Overview
The contact form on `contact.html` is fully functional and configured to send emails to the host based on the selected subject/topic.

## Email Routing System

### How It Works
1. **User selects a subject** from the dropdown (e.g., "Data Question", "Error Report", etc.)
2. **System routes to appropriate email** based on selection:
   - `data-question` → `data@eswatinifacts.com`
   - `error-report` → `issues@eswatinifacts.com`
   - `collaboration` → `data@eswatinifacts.com`
   - `media-inquiry` → `media@eswatinifacts.com`
   - `general` → `info@eswatinifacts.com`
   - `other` → `info@eswatinifacts.com`
3. **Default fallback:** `info@eswatinifacts.com` if no match

### Email Sending Methods (in order of preference)

#### 1. Formspree (Recommended - Currently using fallback)
- **Status:** ⚠️ Needs configuration
- **Setup Required:** 
  - Create account at https://formspree.io/
  - Create forms for each email address
  - Replace placeholder values in `script.js` lines 1054-1057
- **How it works:** Sends form data to Formspree API, which emails the host
- **Reliability:** High - direct email delivery to host inbox

#### 2. EmailJS (Alternative - Currently using fallback)
- **Status:** ⚠️ Needs configuration
- **Setup Required:**
  - Sign up at https://www.emailjs.com/
  - Configure service and template
  - Add EmailJS SDK to HTML
  - Replace placeholder values in `script.js`
- **How it works:** Uses EmailJS service to send emails
- **Reliability:** High - direct email delivery to host inbox

#### 3. Mailto Fallback (Currently Active)
- **Status:** ✅ Always works
- **How it works:** Opens user's default email client with pre-filled message
- **Reliability:** Medium - depends on user having email client configured
- **User Experience:** Opens email client, user clicks send
- **Email Delivery:** Direct to host email addresses ✅

## Current Functionality Status

### ✅ What Works Now
1. **Form validation** - All fields validated before submission
2. **CSRF protection** - Security tokens prevent spam
3. **Email routing** - Correct email address selected based on subject
4. **Mailto fallback** - Always works, opens email client with pre-filled message
5. **User feedback** - Clear success/error messages
6. **Recipient display** - Shows user which email address will receive their message

### ⚠️ What Needs Configuration
1. **Formspree endpoints** - Replace placeholders with actual form IDs (optional but recommended)
2. **EmailJS service** - Configure if you want to use EmailJS instead (optional)

### ✅ Email Delivery Guarantee
- **Current:** Mailto fallback ensures emails CAN reach host (via user's email client)
- **With Formspree/EmailJS:** Direct email delivery to host inbox without user interaction

## Email Addresses Routing

All messages are routed to these host email addresses:

| Subject | Email Address | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Data Question / Collaboration | `data@eswatinifacts.com` | Data requests and collaboration |
| Error Report | `issues@eswatinifacts.com` | Bug reports and errors |
| Media Inquiry | `media@eswatinifacts.com` | Press and media requests |
| General Question / Other | `info@eswatinifacts.com` | General inquiries |

## User Experience Flow

### Current Flow (Mailto Fallback)
1. User fills out form
2. User clicks "Send Message"
3. Form validates input
4. Default email client opens with:
   - **To:** Appropriate email address (e.g., `info@eswatinifacts.com`)
   - **Subject:** Formatted subject (e.g., "Data Question")
   - **Body:** User's name, email, message, newsletter preference
5. User clicks "Send" in their email client
6. ✅ Email is delivered to host

### With Formspree/EmailJS (When Configured)
1. User fills out form
2. User clicks "Send Message"
3. Form validates input
4. Email sent directly to host inbox via API
5. ✅ No user interaction needed - email delivered automatically

## Security Features

✅ **CSRF Protection:** Each form submission includes a security token
✅ **Input Validation:** All fields validated client-side
✅ **Email Validation:** Email format checked before submission
✅ **XSS Prevention:** Form data properly encoded in mailto links
